scenario where player has more than two queens
is it correct to assume for attack boards, we should only consider our own pieces as occupied? we can still attack that square? 
checkmate logic and turn logic both contain code to check if there is move to get out of check....
factor out en passant logic from pawn moves
perft
uci
player input


NOTES TO SELF

how can history and board state be coupled that neither can be out of sync?
