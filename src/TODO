scenario where player has more than two queens
consolidate castling logic
add occ and attack boards? need to rememebr to update them at any point anything is updated
expand isValidMove
is it correct to assume for attack boards, we should only consider our own pieces as occupied? we can still attack that square? 
checkmate logic and turn logic both contain code to check if there is move to get out of check....
capture logic test
factor out en passant logic from pawn moves
fix function parameters - try to be uniform

NOTES TO SELF

we use jest because mohca/chai does not have support for bigint
javascript/typescript - Objects and arrays are passed by reference. Primitive values like number, string, boolean are passed by value. A reference to an object is also a primitive type and passed by value like other primitive types, but the object it refers to is still passed by reference.

global variable CHECK_FLAG in game.ts a good idea?
how can history and board state be coupled that neither can be out of sync?

two weeks until bug free random move games being played

there is some seriously dubious logic going on with the magic bitboard --- need to convert a bigint to a number to set the index, which is outside js's range for a safe int. This needs to be remedied

watch out for cirular imports
