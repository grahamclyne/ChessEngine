scenario where player has more than two queens
is it correct to assume for attack boards, we should only consider our own pieces as occupied? we can still attack that square? 
checkmate logic and turn logic both contain code to check if there is move to get out of check....
factor out en passant logic from pawn moves
perft
uci
player input


NOTES TO SELF

we use jest because mohca/chai does not have support for bigint
javascript/typescript - Objects and arrays are passed by reference. Primitive values like number, string, boolean are passed by value. A reference to an object is also a primitive type and passed by value like other primitive types, but the object it refers to is still passed by reference.

how can history and board state be coupled that neither can be out of sync?

two weeks until bug free random move games being played

there is some seriously dubious logic going on with the magic bitboard --- need to convert a bigint to a number to set the index, which is outside js's range for a safe int. This needs to be remedied

watch out for cirular imports
